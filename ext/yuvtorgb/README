WHAT IT IS
----------

gst-yuvtorgb is a YUV420(I420) to ARGB converter using the libyuv library.

GStreamer version of 1.0 and above is required. A copy of GStreamer can be found at (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)

The plugin depends on the library libyuv, which a copy can be obtained at (https://code.google.com/p/libyuv/). A wiki page of how to obtain and build libyuv can be found at: https://code.google.com/p/libyuv/wiki/GettingStarted

For building the plugin, must have the following set,
    - LIBYUV_CFLAGS: points to the libyuv include folder
    - LIBYUV_LDFLAGS: points to the libyuv library folder
    - LIBYUV_LIBADD: -l<libyuv name>. ex. -lyuv


KNOWN ISSUES AND FUTURE WORKS
-----------------------------

Support of more input/output (sink/src) color spaces.
Dynamically allocating input/output caps based on connected elements.
